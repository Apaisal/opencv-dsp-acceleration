Install DSP/BIOS Link

First untar the DSP/BIOS Link (DSP Link) inside a folder in your working directory. In my case it is /home/jars/Dsp_gsoc, which I will name '*work*' for quick reference.
 {{{
 # mkdir -p work/dsplink
 # cd work/dsplink
 # tar -xvzf /home/jars/Desktop/dsplink_linux_1_64.tar.gz
 }}}
Before we can proceed further, we need to install Code Generation Tools, DSP/BIOS and XDC Tools. These comes in binary form and can be directly installed after making them executable.
 {{{
 # chmod +x /home/jars/Desktop/ti_cgt_c6000_7.0.1_setup_linux_x86.bin
 # chmod +x /home/jars/Desktop/bios_setuplinux_5_41_00_06.bin
 # chmod +x /home/jars/Desktop/xdctools_setuplinux_3_16_00_18.bin
 }}}
After making them executable, we can start installing by executing the binaries.

Installing Code Generation Tools

 {{{
 # /home/jars/Desktop/ti_cgt_c6000_7.0.1_setup_linux_x86.bin
 }}}
It is simple afterward as graphical installation wizard starts and you just have to confirm with certain settings and select your installation directory. In my case the installation directory was selected to be 'work/code_gen'.

Installing DSP/BIOS

 {{{
 # /home/jars/Desktop/bios_setuplinux_5_41_00_06.bin
 }}}
It is simple afterward as graphical installation wizard starts and you just have to confirm with certain settings and select your installation directory. In my case the installation directory was selected to be 'work/bios'.

Installing XDC Tools

 {{{
 # /home/jars/Desktop/xdctools_setuplinux_3_16_00_18.bin
 }}}
It is simple afterward as graphical installation wizard starts and you just have to confirm with certain settings and select your installation directory. In my case the installation directory was selected to be 'work/xdctools'.


After installing all the dependencies, we can now proceed further to install DSP Link.
 
First, we need to configure the make file.
