#Building and testing the 1-D DFT and Sobel_3x3

= Introduction =

This page explains the building and testing procedure of the uploaded examples.

It is assumed that you have a working codec-engine environment. The easiest way to have it through OpenEmbedded. If you have a OpenEmbedded development environment, you just need to do "#bitbake codec-engine". But before that don't forget to read the Readme file at {{{<OE_BASE_DIR>}}}/sources/openembedded/recipes/ti. There may be necessary to download some of the tools manually.

After you have your codec-engine environment, if you want to re-build the codec-engine examples or DSPLink examples you can follow [http://code.google.com/p/opencv-dsp-acceleration/wiki/GettingStarted1 this] for modifying your necessary Makefiles. There is some version mis-match in this particular page and it is recommended to follow only for Makefile changes and executing your examples.
